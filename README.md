# Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to heart disease and building predictive models to forecast the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and the application of machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `heart.csv`, located in the `Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction/` directory. This file contains various medical attributes of patients.

*(You might want to add more details about the dataset here, such as its source, a brief description of its features/columns, and its overall size.)*

## Files in this Repository

*   **`Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction/heart.csv`**: The primary dataset used for the analysis and model training.
*   **`Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction/Heart_Disease_Analysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete Python code for data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
*   **`Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction/Heart_Disease_Analysis.html`**: An HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook, allowing the analysis to be viewed in a web browser without needing to run the notebook.
*   **`Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction/Heart_Disease_Analysis.pdf`**: A PDF version of the analysis, potentially serving as a report.

## Analysis and Prediction Workflow

The `Heart_Disease_Analysis.ipynb` notebook covers the following key steps:
1.  **Data Loading and Inspection:** Importing the dataset and understanding its basic structure.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies in the data.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, relationships between features, and identifying patterns.
4.  **Feature Engineering (if applicable):** Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
5.  **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling numerical features and encoding categorical features for machine learning models.
6.  **Model Training:** Implementing and training various classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) to predict heart disease.
7.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
8.  **Conclusion:** Summarizing the findings and the performance of the predictive models.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the analysis.
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive coding and documentation.
*   **Libraries:**
    *   Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    *   NumPy: For numerical operations.
    *   Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
    *   Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks (model training, evaluation, preprocessing).

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmed-riyaz/Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction.git
    cd Heart-Disease-Analysis-and-Prediction
    ```
2.  **Set up your Python environment:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    You will need to install the necessary Python libraries. If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, you can typically install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
    ```
4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Navigate to the `Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction/` directory and start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    cd "Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction"
    jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Analysis.ipynb
    ```
    Alternatively, you can view the static HTML or PDF versions of the analysis.

## Results/Findings

*(Summarize the key findings from your analysis and the performance of your best predictive model here. For example: "The analysis revealed significant correlations between age, cholesterol levels, and the incidence of heart disease. The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting heart disease.")*
